Research published July 15 in Paediatrics shows that the amount of time parents watch TV is connected to how much TV their children watch, even more so than the location of the TV in the home or the family’s rules for television watching. The American Academy of Paediatrics suggests that children and teens should only be allowed to use “high-quality” entertainment media for one to two hours per day. In addition, the house should have “screen-free” zones like the children’s bedroom, where there are no TVs, computer games or video games. The TV should be turned off during dinner, the academy adds. Each hour of TV viewed by the parents was linked to an additional half hour of viewing time for children. Children whose parents watched more than the average also watched more compared to kids whose parents stuck to the four hours daily. Parents’ TV time had a stronger association to how much time children watched television compared to house rules on time limits, whether the children had a TV in the bedroom and whether the family was watching together. Parents who restricted television time only were able to cut down viewing times for children who were in the 6 to 11-year-old age group. Adolescents watched about one more hour of TV than their parents thought they did, the results also showed.\",\"k\":[],\"a1\":\"https://dn-JBhPksbU.qbox.me/8ec7fe831fe46648cd36.mp3\",\"a2\":\"https://dn-JBhPksbU.qbox.me/4e8c3cfe3a3371fab311.mp3\",\"a3\":\"https://dn-JBhPksbU.qbox.me/6dbfcf6f5b98045b898d.mp3\",\"a4\":\"https://dn-JBhPksbU.qbox.me/f67990a5f7e3e34d363f.mp3\",\"a5\":\"https://dn-JBhPksbU.qbox.me/eab40c03430757b82cc5.mp3\"}","{\"id\":\"58ff39a5570c350058f32102\",\"sn\":438,\"u\":1514190696759,\"c\":1493121445844,\"p\":\"SWT\",\"t\":\"Writing\",\"q\":\"Songbirds\",\"te\":\"Males do the singing and females do the listening.

But its less straightforward to attach a date to a particular ring in an ancient Anasazi wooden beam, because at first you dont know in what year the beam was cut. However, the widths of tree growth rings vary from year to year, depending on the rain or drought conditions in each year. \\n \\nHence the sequence of the rings in a tree cross-section is like a message in Morse code formerly used for sending telegraph messages dot-dot-dash-dot-dash in the Morse code, wide-wide-narrow-wide-narrow in the tree ring sequence. Actually the tree ring sequence is even more diagnostic and richer in information than the Morse code, because trees actually contain rings spanning many different width, rather than the Morse code choice between dot and dash. \\n \\nTree ring specialists (known as dendrochronologists) proceed by noting the sequence of wider and narrower rings in a tree cut down in a known recent year, and also noting the sequences in beams from trees cut down at various times in the past. They then match up and align the tree ring sequences with the same diagnostic widenarrow patterns from different beams. \\n \\nIn that way, dendrochronologists have constructed tree ring records extending back for thousands of years in some parts of the world.

Some 50 years ago the demographic situation was quite different, with the median age of Australia's population being seven years older than Japan's.   The ageing of the population is a major issue for Australian policy makers, particularly in regard to the long-term implications for reduced economic growth and the increasing demand for Age Pensions, and health and aged care services. As the population ages, growth in the number of people of working age will slow, while the proportion of people of retirement age will increase.   Sustained population ageing also leads to slowing or negative population growth. While declining population growth in developed countries is welcomed by some environmentalist and social scientists, economists tend to agree that population decline brings gloomy economic prospects. In addition to the decrease in the labour supply, the demand side of the economy may be affected through shrinking markets for goods and services.   How quickly this occurs depends on the dynamics of fertility, mortality and overseas migration. While a moderate pace of demographic change allows for gradual adjustment of the economy and policies to the changing population demographics, rapid changes are more difficult to manage. As a result, governments and society as a whole may need to take actions to address these issues. But how severe is the ageing of Australia's population, relative to other countries?

This is just in time according to many, as claims of an acute energy crisis are afoot due to high oil prices, population spikes and droughts.

The potential of geothermal energy in the region was first realised internationally by the United Nations Development Program, when geologists observed thermal anomalies below the East African Rift system. Locals have been utilising this resource for centuries using steam vents to create the perfect humidity for greenhouses, or simply to enjoy a swim in the many natural hot lakes. Along the 6000 km of the rift from the Red Sea to Mozambique, geochemical, geophysical and heat flow measurements were made to identify areas suitable for geothermal wells. One area lies next to the extinct Olkaria volcano, within the Hells Gate National Park, and sits over some of the thinnest continental crust on Earth. This is a result of the thinning of the crust by tectonic stretching, causing hotter material below the Earths surface to rise, resulting in higher temperatures. This thin crust was ideal for the drilling of geothermal wells, reaching depths of around 3000 meters, where temperatures get up to 342°C, far higher than the usual temperature of 90°C at this depth. Water in the surrounding rocks is converted to steam by the heat.

There can be little doubt that using an indigenous product must qualify a dish as Australian notes Stephanie Alexander. Similarly, and without qualification, states that a uniquely Australian food culture can only be based upon foods indigenous to this country, although, as Craw remarks, proposing Australian native foods as national symbols relies more upon their association with 'nature' and geographic origin than on common usage Notwithstanding the lack of justification for the premise that national dishes are, of necessity, founded on ingredients native to the country. After all, Italy's gastronomic identity is tied to the non-indigenous tomato, Thailand to then on indigenous chili, the reality is that Austrians do not eat indigenous foods insignificant quantities. The exceptions are fish, crustaceans and shellfish from oceans, rivers and lakes, most of which are unarguably unique to this country. Despite valiant and well-intentioned efforts today at promoting and encouraging the consumption of native resources, bush foods are not harvested or produced in sufficient quantities for them to be a standard component of Australian diets, nor are they generally accessible.

Others in the United States were also developing aircraft at the time the Wright brothers started turning their curiosity skyward. Samuel Langley had flown an unmanned steam-powered aircraft in 1896. Octave Chanute and others were flying gliders near Chicago late in the decade as well. But it wasn’t until the Wright brothers started working on the matter that the “flying problem” would finally be solved. Beginning in 1899, the brothers designed and built a series of gliders to test their various ideas on a flying machine. They constructed a wind tunnel that allowed them to test designs without having to build a full-size model.

The people were hunter-gathers who lived exclusively form what they could find in nature without practicing either agriculture or herding. They hunted the bigger herbivores, while berries, leaves, roots, wild fruit and mushrooms probably played a major role in their diet. \\n\\nTheir hunting was indiscriminate perhaps because so many animals were about they did not need to spare pregnant females or the young. In the cave of Enlene, for example, many bones of reindeer and bison fetuses were found. Apparently, upper Paleolithic people hunted like other predators and killed the weakest prey first. They did, however, sometimes concentrate on salmon suns and migrating herds of reindeer. Contrary to popular beliefs about cave man, upper Paleolithic people did not live deep inside caves. They rather close the foot of cliffs, especially when an overhang provided good shelter. On the plains and in the valleys, they used tents made from hides of the animals they killed. At time, on the great Russian plains, they built huts with huge boned and tusks collected from skeletons of mammals\\n\\nMen hunted mostly with spears, the bow and arrow was probably not invented until the Magdalenian period that came at the end of the Upper Paleolithic. Tools and weapons, made out of wood or reindeer antlers, often had flint cutting edges. Flint snappers were skillful and traditions in flint snapping were purchased for thousands of years. This continuity means that they must have been carefully thought how to find good flint modules and how to snap them in order to make knives, buries (chisel-like tools) or scrapers, which could be used for various purposes.\\n\",\"ch\":[{\"content\":\"Upper Paleolithic people, whose ways of life are known through the remains of meals scattered around hearths, tools and weapons and the debris left over, were hunter-gathers who lived from what they found in nature without practicing agriculture or herding, but they did sometimes concentrate on salmon suns and migrating reindeer herds, and choose the foot of cliffs with an overhang to live, which is contrary to popular belief about cave man.

A recent study conducted by Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital showed that improvements to the physical surroundings of workers impacted on productivity not just because the working environment was more attractive, but because the changes made employees feel cared for. A Swedish research paper revealed a strong link between the type of office an employee worked in and their overall job satisfaction and health. Various findings have emerged as a result of studies such as this. Pot plants and greenery can apparently have a real impact on psychological well-being. Those who work in a private room tend to be in better health than workers based in open-plan offices.Sufficient light can reduce sickness among workers and increase productivity, and an attractive office can make workers feel more cared for and therefore more loyal to their company. Most of these points make good rational sense. But some companies arent content simply to increase the health , productivity and contentment of their employees. Pioneers such as Google, Walt Disney and Dyson have tried to create offices that will do everything from promoting collaboration between workers to stimulating their creative juices. \\\"Environment, both physical and cultural, can make or break creativity\\\", says Kursty Groves, author of I Wish I Worked There!
