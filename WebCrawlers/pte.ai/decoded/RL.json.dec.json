It included the demolition of crowded and unhealthy medieval neighborhoods, the building of wide avenues, parks and squares, the annexation of the suburbs surrounding Paris, and the construction of new sewers, fountains and aqueducts. Haussmann's work met with fierce opposition, and he was finally dismissed by Napoleon III in 1870. but work on his projects continued until 1927. The street plan and distinctive appearance of the center of Paris today is largely the result of Haussmann's renovation.\\n\\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, the center of Paris was overcrowded, dark, dangerous, and unhealthy. In 1845 the French social reformer Victor Considerate wrote\\\"Paris is an immense workshop of putrefaction, where misery, pestilence and sickness work in concert, where sunlight and air rarely penetrate. Paris is a terrible place where plants shrivel and perish, and where, of seven small infants, four die during the course of the year. The street plan on the Tie de la Cite and in the neighborhood called the \\\"quartier des Arcis, between the Louvre and the \\\"Hotel de Ville (City Hall), had changed little since the Middle Ages. The population density in these neighborhoods was extremely high, compared with the rest of Paris. in the neighborhood of the Champs EIysees, there was one resident for every 186 square meters. in the neighborhoods of Arc is and Saint- Avoye, in the present Third Arron dissement, there was one inhabitant for every three square meters. In 1840, a doctor described one building in the tie de la Cite where a single room five meters squares on the fourth floor was occupied by twenty-three people, both adults and children. In these conditions, disease spread very quickly. Cholera epidemics ravaged the city in 1832 and 1848. In the epidemic of 1848, five percent of the inhabitants of these two neighborhoods died. Traffic circulation was another major problem. The widest streets in these two neighborhoods were only five meters wide. the narrowest were only one or two meters wide. Wagons, carriages and carts could barely move through the streets. The center of the city was also a cradle of discontent and revolution. between 1830 and 1848, seven armed uprisings and revolts had broken out in the centre of Paris, particularly along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, around the Hotel de Vi Ile, and around Montagne Sainte-Genevive on the left bank. The residents of these neighborhoods had taken up paving stones and blocked the narrow streets with barricades, and had to be dislodged by the army.\",\"ch\":[{\"content\":\"This lecture mainly talks about the renovation of Paris in 1890s.\"},{\"content\":\"Napoleon the third saw the old Paris was the evil Paris, so he decided to reconstruct it.\"},{\"content\":\"The renovation was vast public program commissioned by Napoleon the third and directed by Haussmann.\"},{\"content\":\"Napoleon the third instructed Haussmann to bring air and light to the center of Paris and to drain the sewages.\"},{\"content\":\"Napoleon also asked Haussmann to plant more trees, build roads and to make the city cleaner and safer.\"},{\"content\":\"The reason for doing this was that the old Paris had many serious problems such as overcrowding, diseases and crimes.\"}],\"k\":[\"demolition\",\"medieval\",\"renovation\",\"pestilence\",\"penetrate\",\"discontent\",\"annexation\",\"aqueducts\",\"putrefaction\",\"inhabitant\",\"revolution\",\"barricades\",\"dislodged\"],\"a5\":\"https://dn-JBhPksbU.qbox.me/d8da696af87766fc66ab.mp3\"}","{\"id\":\"58fd98a261ff4b00666d220a\",\"sn\":82,\"u\":1514190643446,\"c\":1493014690623,\"p\":\"RL\",\"t\":\"Speaking\",\"q\":\"Frog（青蛙变异的影响）\",\"te\":\"Frogs are a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura. The oldest fossil  proto  frog appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is found in tropical rain forests. There are approximately 4,800 recorded species, accounting for over 85% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders.\\n\\nBesides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semipermeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. \\n\\nFrogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in they are breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world.

Why is it dark in space?\\nThat question is not as simple as it may sound. You might think that space appears dark at night because that is when our side of Earth faces away from the Sun as our planet rotates on its axis every 24 hour. But what about all those other far away suns that appear as stars in the night sky? Our own Milky Way galaxy contains over 200 billion stars, and the entire universe probably contains over 100 billion galaxies. You might suppose that many stars would light u the night like daytime.\\nUntil the 20th century, astronomers didn't think it was even possible to count all the stars in the universe. They thought the universe went on forever. In other words, they thought the universe was infinite.\\nBesides being very hard to imagine, the trouble with an infinite universe is that no matter where you look in the night sky, you should see a star. Star should overlap each other in the sky like tree trunks in the middle of a very thick forest. But, if this were the case, the sky would be blazing with light. The problem greatly troubled astronomers and became known as Olbers Paradox. A paradox is a statement that seems to disagree with itself.\\nTo try to explain the paradox, some 19th century scientists thought that dust clouds between the stars must be absorbing a lot of the starlight so it wouldn't shine through to us. But later scientists realized that the dust itself would absorb so much energy from the starlight that eventually it would glow as hot and bright as the stars themselves.\\nAstronomers now realize that the universe is not infinite. A finite universe --- that is, a universe of limited size --- even one with trillions and trillions of stars, just wouldn't have enough stars to light up all of space.\\nAlthough the idea of a finite universe explains why Earths sky is dark at night, other causes work to make it even darker.\",\"ch\":[{\"content\":\"This lecture talked about the darkness between galaxies.

At various times a soldier, journalist, author, and politician, Churchill is generally regarded as one of the most important leaders in British and world history. Considered reactionary on some issues, such as granting independence to Britain's colonies and at times regarded as a self-promoter who changed political parties to further his career, it was his wartime leadership that earned him iconic status. Some of his peacetime decisions, such as restoring the Gold Standard in 1924, were disastrous as was his World War I decision to land troops on the Dardanelles. However, during 1940, when Britain alone opposed Hitler's Nazi Germany in the free world, his stirring speeches inspired, motivated, and uplifted a whole people during their darkest hour. Churchill saw himself as a champion of democracy against tyranny, and was profoundly aware of his own role and destiny. Indeed, he believed that God had placed him on earth to carry out heroic deeds for the protection of Christian civilization and human progress. A providential understanding of history would concur with Churchill's self-understanding. Considered old-fashioned, even reactionary by some people today, he was actually a visionary whose dream was of a united world, beginning with a union of the English-speaking peoples, then embracing all cultures. In his youth, he cut a dashing figure as a cavalry officer as seen in the 1972 film Young Winston directed by Richard Attenborough, but the images of him that are the most widely remembered are as a rather overweight, determined, even pugnacious looking senior statesman as he is depicted to the right.\",\"ch\":[{\"content\":\"This lecture talks about Churchill's contribution to the society. \"},{\"content\":\"In the beginning of the lecture, the speaker mentioned Churchill was one of the most important leaders in British and world history. \"},{\"content\":\"He further discuss that during 1940, his stirring speeches inspired a whole people during their darkest hour. \"},{\"content\":\"At the end of the lecture, the speaker mentioned he was a champion of democracy who supported the protection of Christian civilization and human progress. \"},{\"content\":\"To concludeIn conclusion, Churchill is a great leader in the world\"}],\"k\":[\"iconic\",\"peacetime\",\"disastrous\",\"Dardanelles\",\"stirring\",\"uplifted\",\"tyranny\",\"profoundly\",\"providential\",\"Churchills\",\"cavalry\",\"pugnacious\",\"depicted\"],\"a5\":\"https://dn-JBhPksbU.qbox.me/87d157d8fd3867ddf5c0.mp3\"}","{\"id\":\"59eb403017d0090063761a36\",\"sn\":1649,\"u\":1514190627914,\"c\":1508589616871,\"p\":\"RL\",\"t\":\"Speaking\",\"q\":\"三种刺激sales people 的plan\",\"te\":\"1.

With this type of structure, you'd pay your sales people a straight albeit competitive salary like all of your other employees, and nothing else. No bonuses, no commissions, and few, if any, sales incentives.\\n\\nThis type of compensation plan is most often used when the industry you operate within prohibits direct sales, when sales people work as part of small groups or teams and all contributions are equal, when your sales team is relatively small, or when your sales people are expected to spend much of their time on other responsibilities other than selling.\\n\\nHowever, these plans don't tend to offer motivation to sales people, as there are no incentives for them to work harder.\\n\\n2. Salary plus Commission\\nSalary plus commission sales compensation plans are possibly the most common plans used today. They're structured in a way that sales people receive a lower base salary along with commission pay that makes up the majority of the total compensation.\\n\\nOrganizations use salary plus commission sales compensation plans when there are opportunities to support all sales people on this structure and when there are proper metrics in place for tracking sales to ensure that the splits are fair and accurate.\\n\\nThis type of plan is often the better choice as opposed to straight salary because it offers motivation to increase productivity and to achieve goals. It also offers more stabilitysales people will still get some type of pay even if they're in training, when sales are low during certain months, or if market conditions get volatile.

Commission Only\\nCommission only sales compensation plans are exactly what they sound like you pay your sales people for the sales they bring in and nothing else. There is no guarantee of income.\\n\\nThese types of plans are easier to administer than salary plus commission and provide better value for your money paid as they are based solely on sales achieved. They also tend to attract fewer candidates, but do attract the most top-performing and hardest working sales professionals who know they can make a good income because they know how to sell.

Whether these first migrations involved one or several successive waves and distinct peoples is still subject to academic debate, as is its timing. The minimum widely accepted time frame places presence of humans in Australia at 40,000 to 43,000 years Before Present, while the upper range supported by others is 60,000 to 70,000 years BP.\\n\\nIn any event, this migration was achieved during the closing stages of the Pleistocene epoch, when sea levels were typically much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the Timor Sea than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as Sahul), connected by an extensive land bridge across the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait\\n\\nThe ancestral Australian Aboriginal peoples were thus long established and continued to develop, diversify and settle through much of the continent. As the sea levels again rose at the terminus of the most recent glacial period some 10,000 years ago the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass. However, the newly formed 150 km wide Torres Strait with its chain of islands still provided the means for cultural contact and trade between New Guinea and the northern Cape York Peninsula.\\n\\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s around 120,000 southern Asian refugees migrated to Australia. During that twenty years, Australia first began to adopt a policy of what Minister of Immigration Al Grass by termed \\\"multiculturalism\\\". In 2004-05, Australia accepted 123,000 new settlers,19 a 40% increase over the past 10 years. The largest number of immigrants (40,000 in 200405) moved to Sydney.

Each human-generated flip has a different height and speed, and is caught at a different angle, giving different outcomes.\\n\\nBut using high speed cameras and equations, Diaconis and colleagues have now found that even though humans are largely unpredictable coin flippers, there's still a bias built in, If a coin starts out heads, it ends up heads when caught more often than it does tails.
